Overview

PulseGuard is an AI-powered tool for predicting cardiac events using clinical, demographic, and physiological data. The system highlights at-risk patients before acute complications, supporting research and clinical intervention.

Motivation

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading global cause of death. Early prediction of risk through machine learning can empower preventive cardiac care, improve outcomes, and reduce costs.

Features

Automated cardiac risk scoring using ensemble machine learning and neural models
Visual dashboard for risk prediction output
Modular codebase for easy extension
Supports multiple open datasets (UCI, Kaggle, PhysioNet)

Data Sources

PulseGuard leverages these open-access datasets:
UCI Heart Disease Dataset
Kaggle Cardiovascular Disease Dataset
PhysioNet (ECG records and clinical data)
Each dataset includes age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, ECG, and event outcomes.

Installation
bash
git clone https://github.com/SINDHUJA7360/PulseGuard-AI-Driven-Cardiac-Event-Prediction-System.git
cd PulseGuard-AI-Driven-Cardiac-Event-Prediction-System
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Place your patient records (.csv) in the /data directory.

Run the model:

bash
python cardiac_predictor.py --input data/patients.csv
Access dashboard to review predictions (optional).

File Structure
