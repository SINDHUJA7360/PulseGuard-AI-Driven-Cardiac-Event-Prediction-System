OVERVIEW

PulseGuard is a machine learning-based system designed to predict the likelihood of major cardiac events using clinical and physiological data. The project leverages advanced algorithms to support early intervention and risk stratification for patients at risk for cardiovascular complications.

PROJECT MOTIVATION

Timely prediction of cardiac events improves patient outcomes and reduces hospital readmissions. This system is built to automate risk assessment and provide actionable insights using routinely-collected medical data.

Features

Automated cardiac risk scoring using AI models
Input options for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical data
Visual dashboard with risk predictions and confidence intervals
Extensible for both clinical and research applications

Data Sources

The training dataset includes anonymized clinical records containing patient age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, ECG results, and outcome events. Standard public datasets (e.g., UCI Heart Disease, Kaggle Cardiovascular, and PhysioNet repositories) are used for training, validation, and benchmarking.

Installation

bash
git clone https://github.com/SINDHUJA7360/PulseGuard-AI-Driven-Cardiac-Event-Prediction-System.git
cd PulseGuard-AI-Driven-Cardiac-Event-Prediction-System
pip install -r requirements.txt
Refer to the requirements.txt for all dependencies, including essential packages like pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, and flask.

Usage

Place your patient data CSV file in the /data folder.

Run the prediction script:

bash

python cardiac_predictor.py --input data/patient_data.csv
Review results in the generated report or via dashboard UI.

Code Structure
/data: Contains example datasets.
/models: Saved model files and weights.
cardiac_predictor.py: Main prediction engine.
dashboard.py: Dashboard for visualization.
/docs: Project documentation and reference papers.

Results

Initial testing shows prediction accuracy between 90-95% for major cardiac events using ensemble and neural network models. Results may vary based on data quality and feature selection.

Future Work

Integrate wearable device data (ECG, HRV)
Expand feature support for comorbidities, medications, and lifestyle trends
Deployment to cloud and mobile platforms
